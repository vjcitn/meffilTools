abstract = {Background: In recent years the Illumina HumanMethylation450 (HM450) BeadChip has provided a user-friendly platform to profile DNA methylation in human samples. However, HM450 lacked coverage of distal regulatory elements. Illumina have now released the MethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChip, with new content specifically designed to target these regions. We have used HM450 and whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to perform a critical evaluation of the new EPIC array platform. Results: EPIC covers over 850,000 CpG sites, including >90 % of the CpGs from the HM450 and an additional 413,743 CpGs. Even though the additional probes improve the coverage of regulatory elements, including 58 % of FANTOM5 enhancers, only 7 % distal and 27 % proximal ENCODE regulatory elements are represented. Detailed comparisons of regulatory elements from EPIC and WGBS show that a single EPIC probe is not always informative for those distal regulatory elements showing variable methylation across the region. However, overall data from the EPIC array at single loci are highly reproducible across technical and biological replicates and demonstrate high correlation with HM450 and WGBS data. We show that the HM450 and EPIC arrays distinguish differentially methylated probes, but the absolute agreement depends on the threshold set for each platform. Finally, we provide an annotated list of probes whose signal could be affected by cross-hybridisation or underlying genetic variation. Conclusion: The EPIC array is a significant improvement over the HM450 array, with increased genome coverage of regulatory regions and high reproducibility and reliability, providing a valuable tool for high-throughput human methylome analyses from diverse clinical samples.},

abstract = {Assessing DNA methylation profiles in human blood has become a major focus of epidemiologic inquiry. Understanding variability in CpG-specific DNA methylation over moderate periods of time is a critical first step in identifying CpG sites that are candidates for DNA methylation-based etiologic, diagnostic and prognostic predictors of pathogenesis. Using the Illumina MethylationEPIC [850K] BeadArray, DNA methylation was profiled in paired whole blood samples collected approximately 1 year apart from 35 healthy women enrolled in the Nurses Study II cohort. The median intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) across all CpG loci was 0.19 [Interquartile Range (IQR) 0.00–0.50]; 74.8% of ICCs were in the low range (0–0.5), 16.9% in the mid-range of ICCs (0.5–0.8), and 8.3% in the high-range of ICCs (0.8–1). ICCs were similar for CpG probes on the 450K Illumina array (median 0.17) and the new probes added to the 850K array (median 0.21). ICCs for CpG loci on the sex chromosomes and known metastable epialleles were high (median 0.71, 0.97, respectively), and ICCs among methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) CpGs were significantly higher as compared to non-mQTL CpGs (median 0.73, 0.16, respectively, P < 2 × 10 –16 ). We observed wide variation in DNA methylation stability over a 1-year period. Probes considered non-stable, due to substantial variation over a moderate period of time and with minimal variability across individuals could be removed in large epidemiological studies. Moreover, adjusting for technical variation that arises from using high-dimensional arrays is critical.},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation datasets are growing ever larger both in sample size and genome coverage. Novel computational solutions are required to efficiently handle these data. Results: We have developed meffil, an R package designed for efficient quality control, normalization and epigenome-wide association studies of large samples of Illumina Methylation BeadChip microarrays. A complete re-implementation of functional normalization minimizes computational memory without increasing running time. Incorporating fixed and random effects within functional normalization, and automated estimation of functional normalization parameters reduces technical variation in DNA methylation levels, thus reducing false positive rates and improving power. Support for normalization of datasets distributed across physically different locations without needing to share biologically-based individual-level data means that meffil can be used to reduce heterogeneity in meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There is no cure for castration-recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC) and the mechanisms underlying this stage of the disease are unknown. METHODS We analyzed the transcriptome of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells as they progress to CRPC in vivo using replicate LongSAGE libraries. We refer to these libraries as the LNCaP atlas and compared these gene expression profiles with current suggested models of CRPC. RESULTS Three million tags were sequenced using in vivo samples at various stages of hormonal progression to reveal 96 novel genes differentially expressed in CRPC. Thirty-one genes encode proteins that are either secreted or are located at the plasma membrane, 21 genes changed levels of expression in response to androgen, and 8 genes have enriched expression in the prostate. Expression of 26, 6, 12, and 15 genes have previously been linked to prostate cancer, Gleason grade, progression, and metastasis, respectively. Expression profiles of genes in CRPC support a role for the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (CCNH, CUEDC2, FLNA, PSMA7), steroid synthesis and metabolism (DHCR24, DHRS7, ELOVL5, HSD17B4, OPRK1), neuroendocrine (ENO2, MAOA, OPRK1, S100A10, TRPM8), and proliferation (GAS5, GNB2L1, MT-ND3, NKX3-1, PCGEM1, PTGFR, STEAP1, TMEM30A), but neither supported nor discounted a role for cell survival genes. CONCLUSIONS The in vivo gene expression atlas for LNCaP was sequenced and support a role for the androgen receptor in CRPC.},
